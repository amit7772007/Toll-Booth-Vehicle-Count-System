# Toll-Booth-Vehicle-Count-System

A C mini project that counts different types of vehicles at a toll booth using 1D arrays, loops, conditional statements, and functions.

## 📌 Project Description
The Toll Booth Vehicle Count System is a simple C mini project designed to count
different types of vehicles passing through a toll booth. The project uses 1D
arrays to store vehicle counts and demonstrates basic counting logic used in
real-world systems.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand counting logic in programming
- Apply 1D arrays in a real-life scenario
- Use loops for continuous vehicle counting
- Implement conditional statements for decision making
- Generate a report using functions

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- 1D Arrays
- Loops (while, for)
- Conditional Statements (if, switch)
- Functions
- Input Validation

## 🚗 Vehicle Types Counted
- Car
- Bus
- Truck
- Bike
